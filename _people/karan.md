Hey, I am Karan, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Aerospace Engineering Dept. at CU. I did my undergrad in India and Masterâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering at CU Boulder. At ARIA Systems group I work on developing theories and algorithms that enable robots to operate safely, robustly, and efficiently in unknown and dynamic environments. Currently, I am working on _Verifying_ the safety of complex autonomous systems modeled as neural networks and guaranteeing their safety using Barrier Methods for Safe Autonomy. I am also working on _Synthesizing_ high-level strategies for a robotic manipulator operating in the presence of a human using game-theoretic approaches to enable more human-like behavior for robots. My current research interest includes Formal Methods, Verification and Planning for Autonomous systems, Game Theory, and Control Theory.
