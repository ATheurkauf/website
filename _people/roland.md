Howdy! I'm Roland, a second year master's student studying Aerospace Engineering with a focus on autonomous systems at the University of Colorado Boulder. I received my BS degree in Aerospace Engineering Sciences from CU Boulder as well, and I'm interested in safe control of robots under uncertainty. My research focuses on synthesizing control strategies for accomplishing complex, timed robotic tasks while operating in uncertain environments. In my free time, I enjoy making music and playing board games
